Arcade tools for using LLMs to interact with obsidian

## Creating your new toolkit repo

1. Run `arcade new` and answer all the questions
2. Navigate to your new toolkit directory:
   ```bash
   cd obsidian
   ```
3. Initialize git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
4. Create a new repository in Github with the same name as your new toolkit
   > Note: Don't create a README, LICENSE or .gitignore when creating the repository because `arcade new` has already created these files for you.
5. Add remote and push your code:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/spartee/obsidian.git
   git branch -M main
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Publishing to PyPi

### Generating a PyPi API Key

1. Log into your PyPi account
2. Navigate to your Account settings and add an API token
3. Copy the token
4. In your Github repository:
   - Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name your secret `PYPI_TOKEN`
   - Paste your API Token into the Secret field

### Creating a Release

1. Navigate to your Github repository and click on Releases
2. Create a new tag that corresponds to the version in your toolkit's `pyproject.toml` file
   > Note: This will be 0.0.1 for your first release
